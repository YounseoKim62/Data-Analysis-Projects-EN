Evacuation of epidural hematoma.,2.  Insertion of epidural drain.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,COMPLICATIONS:  ,None.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  ,200 cc.,HISTORY:  ,This is a 64-year-old female who has had an extensive medical history beginning with coronary artery bypass done on emergent basis while she was in Maryland in April of 2003 after having myocardial infarction.  She was then transferred to Beaumont Hospital, at which point, she developed a sternal abscess.  The patient was treated for the abscess in Beaumont and then subsequently transferred to some other type of facility near her home in Warren, Michigan at which point, she developed a second what was termed minor myocardial infarction.,The patient subsequently recovered in a Cardiac Rehab Facility and approximately two weeks later, brings us to the month of August, at which time she was at home ambulating with a walker or a cane, and then sustained a fall and at that point she was unable to walk and had acute progressive weakness and was identified as having a central cord syndrome based on an MRI, which showed record signal change.  The patient underwent cervical laminectomy and seemed to be improving subjectively in terms of neurologic recovery, but objectively there was not much improvement.  Approximately 10 days after the surgery, brings us to today's date, the health officer was notified of the patient's labored breathing.  When she examined the patient, she also noted that the patient was unable to move her extremities.  She was concerned and called the Orthopedic resident who identified the patient to be truly quadriplegic.  I was notified and ordered the operative crew to report immediately and recommended emergent decompression for the possibility of an epidural hematoma.  On clinical examination, there was swelling in the posterior aspect of the neck.  The patient has no active movement in the upper and lower extremity muscle groups.  Reflexes are absent in the upper and lower extremities.  Long track signs are absent.  Sensory level is at the C4 dermatome.  Rectal tone is absent.  I discussed the findings with the patient and also the daughter.  We discussed the possibility of this is permanent quadriplegia, but at this time, the compression of the epidural space was warranted and certainly for exploration reasons be sure that there is a hematoma there and they have agreed to proceed with surgery.  They are aware that it is possible she had known permanent neurologic status regardless of my intervention and they have agreed to accept this and has signed the consent form for surgery.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to OR #1 at ABCD General Hospital on a gurney.  Department of Anesthesia administered fiberoptic intubation and general anesthetic.  A Foley catheter was placed in the bladder.  The patient was log rolled in a prone position on the Jackson table.  Bony prominences were well padded.  The patient's head was placed in the prone view anesthesia head holder.  At this point, the wound was examined closely and there was hematoma at the caudal pole of the wound.  Next, the patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The previous skin incision was reopened.  At this point, hematoma properly exits from the wound.  All sutures were removed and the epidural spaces were encountered at this time.  The self-retaining retractors were placed in the depth of the wound.  Consolidated hematoma was now removed from the wound.  Next, the epidural space was encountered.  There was no additional hematoma in the epidural space or on the thecal sac.  A curette was carefully used to scrape along the thecal sac and there was no film or lining covering the sac.  The inferior edge of the C2 lamina was explored and there was no compression at this level and the superior lamina of T1 was explored and again no compression was identified at this area as well.  Next, the wound was irrigated copiously with one liter of saline using a syringe.  The walls of the wound were explored.  There was no active bleeding.  Retractors were removed at this time and even without pressure on the musculature, there was no active bleeding.  A #19 French Hemovac drain was passed percutaneously at this point and placed into the epidural space.  Fascia was reapproximated with #1 Vicryl sutures, subcutaneous tissue with #3-0 Vicryl sutures.  Steri-Strips covered the incision and dressing was then applied over the incision.  The patient was then log rolled in the supine position on the hospital gurney.  She remained intubated for airway precautions and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  Once in the recovery room, she was alert.  She was following simple commands and using her head to nod, but she did not have any active movement of her upper or lower extremities.  Prognosis for this patient is guarded.\",\n          \"CHIEF COMPLAINT:, Pressure decubitus, right hip.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:, This is a 30-year-old female patient presenting with the above chief complaint. She has a history of having had a similar problem last year which resolved in about three treatments. She appears to have residual from spina bifida, thus spending most of her time in a wheelchair. She relates recently she has been spending up to 16 hours a day in a wheelchair. She has developed a pressure decubitus on her right trochanter ischial area of several weeks' duration. She is now presenting for evaluation and management of same. Denies any chills or fever, any other symptoms.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:, Back closure for spina bifida, hysterectomy, breast reduction, and a shunt.,SOCIAL HISTORY:, She denies the use of alcohol, illicits, or tobacco.,MEDICATIONS:, Pravachol, Dilantin, Toprol, and Macrobid.,ALLERGIES:, SULFA AND LATEX.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:, Other than the above aforementioned, the remaining ROS is unremarkable.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL: A pleasant female with deformity of back.,HEENT: Head is normocephalic. Oral mucosa and dentition appear to be normal.,CHEST: Breath sounds equal and present bilateral.,CVS: Sinus.,GI: Obese, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly.,EXTREMITIES: Deformity of lower extremities secondary to spina bifida.,SKIN: She has a full-thickness pressure decubitus involving the right hip which is 2 x 6.4 x 0.3, moderate amount of serous material, appears to have good granulation tissue.,PLAN:, Daily applications of Acticoat, pressure relief, at least getting out of the chair for half of the time, at least eight hours out of the chair, and we will see her in one week.,DIAGNOSIS:, Sequelae of spina bifida; pressure decubitus of right hip area.\",\n          \"SUBJECTIVE: , This patient presents to the office today because of some problems with her right hand.  It has been going tingling and getting numb periodically over several weeks.  She just recently moved her keyboard down at work.  She is hoping that will help.  She is worried about carpal tunnel.  She does a lot of repetitive type activities.  It is worse at night.  If she sleeps on it a certain way, she will wake up and it will be tingling then she can usually shake out the tingling, but nonetheless it is very bothersome for her.  It involves mostly the middle finger, although, she says it also involves the first and second digits on the right hand.  She has some pain in her thumb as well.  She thinks that could be arthritis.,OBJECTIVE: , Weight 213.2 pounds, blood pressure 142/84, pulse 92, respirations 16.  General:  The patient is nontoxic and in no acute distress.  Musculoskeletal:  The right hand was examined.  It appears to be within normal limits and the appearance is similar to the left hand.  She has good and equal grip strength noted bilaterally.  She has negative Tinel's bilaterally.  She has a positive Phalen's test.  The fingers on the right hand are neurovascularly intact with a normal capillary refill.,ASSESSMENT:  ,Numbness and tingling in the right upper extremity, intermittent and related to the positioning of the wrist.  I suspect carpal tunnel syndrome.,PLAN:  ,The patient is going to use Anaprox double strength one pill every 12 hours with food as well as a cock-up wrist splint.  We are going to try this for two weeks and if the condition is still present, then we are going to proceed with EMG test at that time.  She is going to let me know.  While she is here, I am going to also get her the blood test she needs for her diabetes.  I am noting that her blood pressure is elevated, but improved from the last visit.

this is a 64yearold female who has had an extensive medical history beginning with coronary artery bypass done on emergent basis while she was in maryland in april of 2003 after having myocardial infarction  she was then transferred to beaumont hospital at which point she developed a sternal abscess  the patient was treated for the abscess in beaumont and then subsequently transferred to some other type of facility near her home in warren michigan at which point she developed a second what was termed minor myocardial infarctionthe patient subsequently recovered in a cardiac rehab facility and approximately two weeks later brings us to the month of august at which time she was at home ambulating with a walker or a cane and then sustained a fall and at that point she was unable to walk and had acute progressive weakness and was identified as having a central cord syndrome based on an mri which showed record signal change  the patient underwent cervical laminectomy and seemed to be improving subjectively in terms of neurologic recovery but objectively there was not much improvement  approximately 10 days after the surgery brings us to todays date the health officer was notified of the patients labored breathing  when she examined the patient she also noted that the patient was unable to move her extremities  she was concerned and called the orthopedic resident who identified the patient to be truly quadriplegic  i was notified and ordered the operative crew to report immediately and recommended emergent decompression for the possibility of an epidural hematoma  on clinical examination there was swelling in the posterior aspect of the neck  the patient has no active movement in the upper and lower extremity muscle groups  reflexes are absent in the upper and lower extremities  long track signs are absent  sensory level is at the c4 dermatome  rectal tone is absent  i discussed the findings with the patient and also the daughter  we discussed the possibility of this is permanent quadriplegia but at this time the compression of the epidural space was warranted and certainly for exploration reasons be sure that there is a hematoma there and they have agreed to proceed with surgery  they are aware that it is possible she had known permanent neurologic status regardless of my intervention and they have agreed to accept this and has signed the consent form for surgeryoperative procedure  the patient was taken to or 1 at abcd general hospital on a gurney  department of anesthesia administered fiberoptic intubation and general anesthetic  a foley catheter was placed in the bladder  the patient was log rolled in a prone position on the jackson table  bony prominences were well padded  the patients head was placed in the prone view anesthesia head holder  at this point the wound was examined closely and there was hematoma at the caudal pole of the wound  next the patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion  the previous skin incision was reopened  at this point hematoma properly exits from the wound  all sutures were removed and the epidural spaces were encountered at this time  the selfretaining retractors were placed in the depth of the wound  consolidated hematoma was now removed from the wound  next the epidural space was encountered  there was no additional hematoma in the epidural space or on the thecal sac  a curette was carefully used to scrape along the thecal sac and there was no film or lining covering the sac  the inferior edge of the c2 lamina was explored and there was no compression at this level and the superior lamina of t1 was explored and again no compression was identified at this area as well  next the wound was irrigated copiously with one liter of saline using a syringe  the walls of the wound were explored  there was no active bleeding  retractors were removed at this time and even without pressure on the musculature there was no active bleeding  a 19 french hemovac drain was passed percutaneously at this point and placed into the epidural space  fascia was reapproximated with 1 vicryl sutures subcutaneous tissue with 30 vicryl sutures  steristrips covered the incision and dressing was then applied over the incision  the patient was then log rolled in the supine position on the hospital gurney  she remained intubated for airway precautions and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition  once in the recovery room she was alert  she was following simple commands and using her head to nod but she did not have any active movement of her upper or lower extremities  prognosis for this patient is guarded\",\n          \"chief complaint pressure decubitus right hiphistory of present illness this is a 30yearold female patient presenting with the
